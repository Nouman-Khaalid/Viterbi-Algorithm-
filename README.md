# Viterbi-Algorithm-
This README file contains instructions on how to set up and run the Viterbi algorithm for exploring
sequences of dice throws to determine if they are from a fair or loaded die.

**Basics**
Before running the program make sure you should have Python installed on your system with the
following libraries:
NumPy
 Matplotlib
 scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:
 Pip install Numpy
 Pip install Matplotlib
 Pip install scikit-learn

 
**Methods in Package**
 This file or package Contains the main implementation of the Viterbi algorithm along with the
functions to generate test data and evaluate the model.

 Test Viterbi algorithm performance over a range of sequence lengths and plot the results:
Output
o Length=200
o Length=300
o Length=400

 This package also generate the plots of accuracy vs number of throws /or Size and MCC vs
number of throws. Here is the following graphs

**Note**
Make sure all necessary libraries are installed in your machine carefully . If you further meet errors or
other library-related issues, double-check that each library has been installed nad import properly.
Thanks
